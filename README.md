# My-first-game-on-C-
Hallo everyone!I am junior programmer and that my first game. I will be glad to absolutely any criticism, or advice on the code (:

A game that can be played by two players.

At the start, players are asked to enter their nicknames, or select the game mode against the computer.
Nicknames are stored until the end of the game.

The program guesses a random number gameNumber, the interval of which the player provides.

Players take turns (the game reports the current player's progress)

The player whose turn is indicated enters the number userTry, which can take the value that the player has prescribed, the entered number is subtracted from the gameNumber

The new value for gameNumber is shown to the players on the screen.

The winner is the player, after whose move gameNumber turns to zero.
